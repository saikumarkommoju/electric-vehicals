            <p class = "about-card-paragraph">The power of a vehicle's electric motor, as in other machines, is measured in kilowatts (kW). Electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide RPM range. This means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100 kW electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100 kW internal combustion engine, which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed.</p>

            <p class = "about-card-paragraph">While making an expensive purchase, buyers mostly rely on the opinion of existing owners or users. In the case of EVs, there are already several concerns about cost and convenience, hence, real-time feedback from friends and family appears reliable. This gives brand marketers a great indirect marketing and sales team in the form of existing owners (95%) who are inclined to encourage non-EV owners to switch to electric vehicles. However, if the product does not meet the needs of the existing owners or creates a negative experience, then this can work against the brand, hence it's important for marketers to create fantastic experiences for their consumers at every touchpoint.</p>

        <ul class="EV-points">
          <li>Energy Efficiency: EVs are more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles. They convert a higher percentage of the energy from the battery to power the wheels, resulting in lower energy consumption per mile traveled.</li>
          <li>Cost Savings: Operating an electric vehicle can be more cost-effective in the long run. EVs generally have lower fuel costs compared to gasoline or diesel vehicles, and they require less maintenance due to fewer moving parts.</li>
          <li>Acceleration and Performance: Electric vehicles are known for their instant torque, providing quick acceleration and smooth performance. They offer a responsive and enjoyable driving experience</li>
          <li>Environmental Benefits: Electric vehicles (EVs) produce zero tailpipe emissions, which means they do not release harmful pollutants into the air during operation. They help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to improved air quality.</li>
          <li>Range and Charging Infrastructure: Electric vehicles have varying ranges, with some models capable of traveling over 300 miles on a single charge. Charging infrastructure, including public charging stations and home charging units, continues to expand, making it more convenient to recharge EVs.</li>
          <li>Future of Transportation: Electric vehicles play a crucial role in transitioning to a more sustainable and cleaner transportation system. They are a key component of the ongoing efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change.</li>
